Hello, I'm Jin Di, but you can just call me Jin.

I'm currently a student at the University of Toronto's iSchool studying Information Sciences with a focus in UX and Data Sciences. I'm still figuring out which direction I want to head into.

If you want to contact me, you can email me at: chrislu2234\@gmail.com
